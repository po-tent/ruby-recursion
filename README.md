# Ruby Recursion
This is part of The Odin Project, Ruby recursion section. The first warmup is the fibonacci array using iterator and recursion. The main part is to recreate the merge sort using ruby.
## Fibonacci Array
This is a warmup practice for using recursion. The first ```fibs(n)``` is a function returning a fibonacci array using iterator. The second function ```fibs_rec(n)``` does the same thing like the ```fibs(n)``` but using recursion.

## Merge Sort
Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:

  1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
  2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
